## Mastery Check (Project)

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

With this module, you now have the ability to build a web application where users can create, read, update, and delete data that they own.
A user can have their own tweets, todos, journal entries, friends, playlists, etc.

For this module, your mastery check is to build a project that exercises this ability.

Here are the baseline requirements. Your application must:

- Allow Users to:
  - [ ] sign-up
  - [ ] login
  - [ ] logout
  - [ ] create new data in the system that is associated with the user
  - [ ] update data in the system that is associated with the user
  - [ ] read data from the system that is associated with the user
  - [ ] delete data in the system that is associated with the user
- [ ] Use Form objects to validate user data
- [ ] Use appropriate database relationship fields to model relationships between data
- [ ] Restrict some pages to logged in users
- [ ] Utilize Permissions (and possibly Groups) to control user authorization. For example:
  - You app could have an admin or moderator user group that has more permissions than a standard user.
  - You app could involve two different kinds of users that use the website in complementary ways. For example:
    - Github Classroom: Teachers create assignments that they give to students
    - LinkedIn: Companies create jobs that candidates apply to
    - Uber: Riders request rides, and a Driver provides rides

Car rental app.

Users can sign up, log in, and list their cars for rent. They can provide details about each car, such as year, make, model.

Other users can then browse the available cars, select the ones they're interested in, and rent those vehicles

For permissions and groups, there will be rentors and rentees. rentees can browse and rent cars, while rentors have additional permissions to list their cars and manage their garage.

This app will use form objects to validate car listings and rental requests, and appropriate database relationships to track cars, users, and bookings. Certain pages, such as car listing management will be restricted to logged-in users.
